    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<b> What are the requirements to adopt a dog? </b>
<br />
To adopt, you must be at least 18 years old, have a stable living situation,
<br />
and demonstrate the ability to provide a safe, loving home.
<br />
 If you rent, we may ask for proof of pet-friendly housing.
<br />
<br />
<b> How long does the adoption process take? </b>
<br />
The timeline varies, but most adoptions are completed within 1–2 weeks.
<br />
 This includes application review, meet-and-greet sessions, and home checks if required.
<br />
<br />
<b> What is included in the adoption fee? </b>
<br />
The adoption fee covers spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and a health check.
<br />
It also helps us continue caring for other dogs at the shelter.
<br />
<br />
<b> Can I return a dog if things don’t work out? </b>
<br />
Yes, we understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise.
<br />
 If it doesn’t work out, we require the dog to be returned to us.
<br />
We’ll work with you to ensure the best outcome for the dog.
<br />
<br />
<b> Do you allow out-of-state adoptions? </b>
<br />
Yes, we allow out-of-state adoptions, but adopters must travel to our
<br />
shelter for the meet-and-greet and to pick up their new pet.
<br />
<br />
<b> Can I adopt if I already have pets at home? </b>
<br />
Absolutely! We encourage a meet-and-greet with your current
<br />
pets to ensure compatibility. Let us know in your application so
<br />
we can guide you through the process.
<br />
<br />
<b> What kind of support does Adogtion offer post-adoption? </b>
<br />
We provide resources like training tips, a list of recommended veterinarians,
<br />
and access to our team for ongoing questions.
<br />
We’re here to help you and your dog adjust to your new life together!
<br />
<br />
<b> Can I visit the shelter without an appointment? </b>
<br />
To ensure each visitor has ample time to meet our dogs,
<br />
we ask that you schedule an appointment.
<br />
 Walk-ins may be accommodated during specific hours, depending on staff availability.
<br />
<br />
<b> Do you have puppies available? </b>
<br />
Occasionally! While we often care for adult dogs, puppies do come into the shelter.
<br />
 Keep an eye on our website for the most up-to-date listings.
<br />
<br />
<b> How do I know which dog is right for me? </b>
<br />
Our adoption team is here to help! We’ll consider your lifestyle, preferences,
<br />
and experience to recommend dogs that fit your needs.
<br />
