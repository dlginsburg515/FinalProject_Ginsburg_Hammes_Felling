    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

What are the requirements to adopt a dog?
To adopt, you must be at least 18 years old, have a stable living situation, and demonstrate the ability to provide a safe, loving home. If you rent, we may ask for proof of pet-friendly housing.

How long does the adoption process take?
The timeline varies, but most adoptions are completed within 1–2 weeks. This includes application review, meet-and-greet sessions, and home checks if required.

What is included in the adoption fee?
The adoption fee covers spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and a health check. It also helps us continue caring for other dogs at the shelter.

Can I return a dog if things don’t work out?
Yes, we understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise. If it doesn’t work out, we require the dog to be returned to us. We’ll work with you to ensure the best outcome for the dog.

Do you allow out-of-state adoptions?
Yes, we allow out-of-state adoptions, but adopters must travel to our shelter for the meet-and-greet and to pick up their new pet.

Can I adopt if I already have pets at home?
Absolutely! We encourage a meet-and-greet with your current pets to ensure compatibility. Let us know in your application so we can guide you through the process.

What kind of support does Adogtion offer post-adoption?
We provide resources like training tips, a list of recommended veterinarians, and access to our team for ongoing questions. We’re here to help you and your dog adjust to your new life together!

Can I visit the shelter without an appointment?
To ensure each visitor has ample time to meet our dogs, we ask that you schedule an appointment. Walk-ins may be accommodated during specific hours, depending on staff availability.

Do you have puppies available?
Occasionally! While we often care for adult dogs, puppies do come into the shelter. Keep an eye on our website for the most up-to-date listings.

How do I know which dog is right for me?
Our adoption team is here to help! We’ll consider your lifestyle, preferences, and experience to recommend dogs that fit your needs. You can also read detailed profiles of each dog on our website.
